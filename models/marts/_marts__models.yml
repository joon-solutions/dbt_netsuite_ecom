          Transaction amount, difference between amount debit and credit.
          For some accounts, the side will be either on the left (Debit) or right (Credit). This depends on accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Equity
          For example, asset, expense account will be on the debit side since they decrease equity of business (drawings)
          Liabilities and revenue will be on the credit side since they increase equity of the business (investments)
          There're also cases of reverse entries. For example, when customer return an order => revenue will be reduced and on the debit side => net amount will be difference between debit and credit
          The case when condition decides whether to put debit or credit first in the equation, which depends on the above principle
